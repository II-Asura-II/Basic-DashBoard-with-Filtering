# Basic Dashboard

This project is a **React + TypeScript** application built with **Vite** and styled using **Tailwind CSS**. It features a dashboard interface with a dynamic and interactive table component.

## Features

The table allows users to:
- **Sort data** by columns (e.g., client name, country, date, etc.).
- **Filter data** using multiple criteria (e.g., status, project type).
- **Search** through the data with a query input.
- **Paginate** through large datasets for better usability.

## Overview

The application displays project-related data, including:
- Client details
- Progress
- Status

It provides a clean, responsive UI. Dropdown menus and input fields enhance interactivity, while **React Icons** are used for visual improvements. The project follows a modular, component-based architecture for scalability and maintainability.
