# React + TypeScript + Vite

This project is a React + TypeScript application built with Vite and styled using Tailwind CSS. It features a dashboard with a sidebar and a dynamic table component that supports sorting, filtering, searching, and pagination. The table displays project data, including client details, progress, and status, and allows users to interact with the data through dropdown menus and input fields. The project also uses React Icons for UI enhancements and follows a modular component-based architecture.
